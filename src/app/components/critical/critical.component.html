      <h2 class="logistics-subtitle">Real-Time Off-Road Passability and Supply Chain Continuity with LizoAI</h2>
      <p class="logistics-description">
        LizoAI ensures critical supply chain movement by transforming raw geospatial data into dynamic traversability maps. 
        By analyzing the intersection of terrain slope, soil conditions, and land cover, the platform identifies the most 
        efficient and safe routes for off-road vehicle deployment.
