      <h2 class="disaster-subtitle">Real-Time LiDAR Processing and Integrated Flood Modelling with LizoAI</h2>
      <p class="disaster-description">
        From live LiDAR acquisition to hydraulically reliable flood extents, LizoAI delivers real-time terrain processing 
        and integrated flood modelling within a single intelligent platform. This workflow drastically reduces the time 
        from survey to actionable emergency response.
